# Udacity-Projects
Differing projects performed during the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Programme
Using Python through jupyter notebooks various analysis were peformed as projects to fulfill the requirements for the course.
Here are two of the projects:
- Twitter Dogs
- FordGo Bike Share 

## Twitter Dogs

## FordGo Bike Share

### Summary of Findings
The data provided required some cleaning as the dataset was dirty and there were missing values which could alter the outcome of the analysis. The main feautures of this analysis centered around the duration of each bike ride & the type of users(Customer & Subscriber). Other features included which stations were mostly used, which day of the week featured the most rides, which period of the day had the most ride count.
There were 16 columns, one of which was removed during the Data wrangling process to make way for a few more columns. The Start and End time column type had to be changed to calculate the days of the week and Period of day. This was also used to calculate the Age of the Bike riders.



### Key Insights for Presentation
> It is shown that for both Customer & Subscribers, there is a significant amount of male users compared to female users.
 Across the week it looked as though weekdays had high turnout for ride duration with the highest being on thursday.
 Subscribers tend to spend more ride minutes as compared Customers.
 Morning and Evening periods are where bike rides are at their highest.
